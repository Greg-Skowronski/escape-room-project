Congratulations!
You are so smart and brilliant. You have already been a great help for me,
but I must disappoint you. It was just the beginning of the problems.
This one is a lot trickier as it concerns my memory.
Someone played with it and I lost track of some important data that are
necessary to carry out important simulation.
Your task is to write a code that will find the max value in the memory area
that you see on the screen. 
Good luck and happy coding!
