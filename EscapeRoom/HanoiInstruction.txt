Well Done! You went so far!
This task is a little bit different as it concerns my memory.
Someone manipulated with it and now my data are not in place.
Your task is to move the data from the 1st stack to the 3rd one. 
But there is a catch!
1. You can move just one disk at the time.
2. No disk can be placed on top of the smaller disk.
Good Luck!
